          Ascent was the first new map to be added since Valorant’s official
          release. It’s a two site map that is located in Venice, Italy.
          Compared to the other maps, Ascent has the most open area with a large
          courtyard at the center of the map.

          The courtyard offers a quick short cut to the sides of the map but is
          risky to cross since it doesn’t contain that much cover. Another
          signature feature that is unique to Ascent is its closeable doors. At
          each defensive site, there is a door that can be open or closed using
          a switch. The door is armored but can be broken.
