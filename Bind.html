          Bind is a two site map (A and B) that has attackers infiltrating from
          a beach coast. Site A is accessible through an alleyway in the middle
          of the map called “short A” or through a building’s hallway called,
          “showers”. Site B is accessible by a path along the beach called “long
          B” or through a marketplace and window called “hookah”.
        </p>

        <p>
          A unique aspect of this map is that there are two one-way teleporters.
          One teleporter takes you from long B to the attacker’s side of
          showers. The other takes you from short A to the attacker’s side of
          hookah. These allow both attackers and defenders alike to quickly
          rotate or flank the opposing team.
        </p>

        <p>
          The teleporter is incredibly noisy so it is somewhat risky to do so if
          your enemies are expecting it. You can also throw projectiles, drones,
          and guns through teleporters.
        </p>

        <p>
          One ultimate orb can be found inside the showers while the other is at
          long B right in front of the teleporter.
