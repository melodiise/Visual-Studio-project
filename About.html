        The game was originally announced in October 2019 as Project A, and
        League of Legends developer Riot Games officially announced it as
        Valorant a few months later. It’s somewhat of a post-postmodern game,
        combining elements of Overwatch, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and,
        of course, League of Legends.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s a 5v5 multiplayer first-person shooter (FPS) where one team attacks
        and the other defends. The main game mode, Search and Destroy, is very
        similar to CS:GO. The attacking team’s goal is to plant a bomb (called a
        spike) and have it detonate, while the defending team tries to avoid
        that. Regardless of whether the spike is planted or not, if a squad is
        wiped out before any other victory condition is met, the opposing squad
        will win.
      </p>
      <p>
        Matches are 25 rounds long, with each round lasting 100 seconds. The
        first team to win 13 rounds wins the match overall. At the beginning of
        the round, you’ll have 30 seconds to buy weapons and gear for that
        round. If you die in a round, you’ll have to wait until the next round
        to respawn. This main game mode can be played in either unrated or
        ranked matches.
      </p>
      <p>
        It sounds just like CS:GO’s Defuse game mode, but Riot has a twist on
        the formula. In addition to buying weapons, you’ll also choose an Agent
        at the beginning of each round. Each Agent has an ability, ranging from
        healing allies to making walls appear out of nowhere. Considering
        Valorant takes a MOBA-based approach to Agents, you’ll likely need a
        good spread of abilities if you want to win a match. Note, however, that
        you’ll need to buy some abilities at the beginning of a round.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since launch, Valorant has added the Spike Rush game mode. This is a
        quicker, best-of-seven-rounds mode where every attacker is equipped with
        a spike, and all players have the same weapon and all of their
        abilities; there is no buy round.
      </p>
      <p>
        Valorant‘s seasons will be known as Acts, each bringing new additions to
        the game including new Agents, maps, and modes.
