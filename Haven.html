          Haven is a three site map (A, B, C), which is also its unique aspect
          as most bomb/defusal maps in FPS games tend to be two sites. Site A is
          accessible through an L-shaped’ alleyway called “long A” or through an
          underground passage called “sewers” (A-short). As expected, long A is
          more suited for long-ranged engagements while the sewers will bring
          close quarter combat.

          Site B is accessible through a window which leads into an outdoor
          courtyard. The courtyard also leads to a set of doors called “garage”
          which allows attackers to wrap around to Site B. The garage also acts
          as a connector to Site C, so attackers that make it through can
          threaten both B and C. The other entry point to Site C is through a
          straight alleyway called “long C”. Long C has a cubby partway through
          so attackers can use smokes to advance safely. The two ultimate orbs
          can be found at Site A outside of long A or at Site C outside of long
          C.
